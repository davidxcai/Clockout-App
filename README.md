## About

A light-weight app to minimize clock-out time errors.

Enter your clock-in time to calculate the time you clock-out. If you work more than 6 hours, a 30
minute lunch will be included.

I developed this app for a very particular reason which is to prevent time-adjustment requests at work. Our current time system does not explicitly tell you when you need to clock-out, requiring you to do some math. This may sound simple however there are times when we work unusual hours which often leads to mis-punches.
